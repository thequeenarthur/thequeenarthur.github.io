        <p>My name is Queen Arthur, and I am fifteen years old- the same age Hiccup Haddock defeated the Red Death, and the same age Harry Potter fought Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries! I haven't fought any Red Deaths or Death Eaters yet, but in the meantime, I've decided to record my memoirs in this new blog, the Disorder of the Phoenix. (It was either that or Knights of the Round Tablet.)</p>
        <h5>Wherefore Art Thou?</h5>
        <p>I'm not going to tell you where I live! "Wherefore art thou" actually means "why are you." So why am I Queen Arthur? Because I love the King Arthur legends, but I hate the patriarchy. What's wrong with having a powerful female leader? Also the name The Girl Who Lived was taken. So... Queen Arthur it is.</p>
        <p>Professional fangirl isn't a career according to my guidance counselor, but I actually know several professional fangirls! There are lots of bloggers, journalists, and academics whose main focus is fandom. And you can order cosplayers for parties. (Edit: A cosplayer is NOT a stripper, Dad. And Dad the Impaler is such an off-putting username. Please change it. Now.)</p>
        <h5>More About Me</h5>
        <img class="chess" src ="images/Pawn Mirror King.jpeg" alt="chess picture">
        <p>In addition to being a fangirl, I am also an actress! My high school is doing Spamalot for its spring musical this year, and I am so excited! I really hope I get cast as the Lady in the Lake. But I'm actually trying out for King Arthur, just to prove that I can.</p>
        <p>I have also a pet dragon named Tad Cooper. My mom says he's just a lizard, but I know he's really a Terrible Terror. My dad agrees with me... although I suspect he means something different.</p>
        <p>In the Round Table section of my website, I've uploaded a few pieces that I made myself. Feel free to comment on them/send them to JK Rowling's agent!</p>
